        Hi, my name is Lucas Unterberger and I am a Data Engineer/Data Scientist from Austria.
        I have a background in mathematics and enjoy solving problems and learning interesting things.
        <br><br>
        During university I discovered the joy of programming and since then I try to improve my skills every year.
        Although I learned C, C++, Matlab and Maple in uni, I am mainly coding in Python now as it is the defacto language for Data Engineers and Scientists and I learned to love its easy of use.
        <br><br>
        Lately I've taken an interest in hosting apps locally, so I'm constantly reconfiguring my Raspberry Pi with new containers. 
        Maybe this website will also migrate to my Pi or Azure at some point. 
        There are still a lot of things for me to learn and I plan to steadily progress my non Data Engineering skills like hosting, web dev, backend and game dev.
        <br><br>
        I will continue creating content for this site and update it.
